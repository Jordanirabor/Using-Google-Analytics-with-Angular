 ## Using Google Analytics with Angular


## Getting Started

Clone the project repository by running the command below

`git clone https://github.com/Jordanirabor/Using-Google-Analytics-with-Angular`

If you use https, use this instead


## Setup

There isn't so much to do afterwards, the code is very simple and shows how to write the Angular run block so it sends data to google analytics whenever transition to a new page is successfully completed.

Enjoy!
